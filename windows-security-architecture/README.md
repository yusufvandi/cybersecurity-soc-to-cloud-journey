# Week 1 — Windows Security Architecture Basics

## Objective
The objective of this module is to develop a foundational understanding of **Windows security architecture**, with particular emphasis on **authentication mechanisms, identity handling, and security event logging**.

This knowledge forms the basis for effective SOC operations and provides critical context for identity and access management in cloud-integrated environments.

## Learning Outcomes
By the end of this module, I aimed to:
- Explain Windows authentication processes in clear and accurate terms
- Understand the distinction between local users and administrators
- Identify where and why Windows records security-related events
- Interpret basic security log fields relevant to SOC analysis

---

## Core Topics Covered
- Windows authentication workflow
- User privilege levels and access control
- Purpose and limitations of security logs
- Introduction to Windows Event Logging
- Role of authentication logs in monitoring and investigations

---

## Relevance to Cybersecurity and Cloud Engineering
Windows remains a dominant operating system in enterprise environments.  
Understanding its authentication and logging mechanisms is essential for:
- SOC monitoring and alerting
- Incident response and forensic analysis
- Integration with Active Directory and cloud IAM platforms
- Detection of identity-based attacks

This module establishes the conceptual groundwork required for later transitions into **cloud identity systems** and **security engineering**.
