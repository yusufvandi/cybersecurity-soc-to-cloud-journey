# Cybersecurity SOC to Cloud Security Journey

## Overview
This repository documents my structured and progressive learning journey in cybersecurity, with an initial focus on **Security Operations Center (SOC) fundamentals** and a long-term transition toward **Cloud Security Engineering**.

The purpose of this repository is not only skill acquisition, but also **academic reflection, documentation of practical experimentation, and continuous improvement**. It is designed to evolve as my knowledge deepens across operating systems, identity and access management (IAM), logging, detection engineering, and cloud-native security architectures.

This repository serves as:
- A personal academic record of applied cybersecurity learning
- A technical portfolio aligned with SOC and cloud security roles
- Evidence of disciplined, self-directed learning relevant to graduate-level study and research

---

## Learning Philosophy
My approach emphasizes:
- Strong foundational understanding before specialization
- Hands-on experimentation supported by documentation
- Clear linkage between theoretical concepts and real-world security operations
- Gradual progression from on-premise systems to cloud environments

Rather than treating cybersecurity as isolated tools or certifications, this repository reflects a **systems-level understanding** of security engineering and defense.

## Repository Structure (Evolving)
The repository is organized in weekly modules, each focused on a core security domain.  
While the structure below represents the current organization, it will **continuously evolve** as new topics, tools, and research interests are added.

cybersecurity-soc-to-cloud-journey/ │ ├── README.md │ ├── week-01-windows-security-architecture/ │   ├── README.md │   ├── notes.md │   └── lab-observations.md │ ├── week-02-linux-authentication-logging/ │   └── README.md │ ├── week-03-network-logging-fundamentals/ │   └── README.md │ └── resources/ └── references.md

Future modules will expand into areas such as:
- SIEM and detection logic
- Identity-based attacks
- Cloud IAM and zero trust architectures
- Incident response and threat hunting
- Security automation and engineering

## Academic and Professional Relevance
The competencies developed through this repository directly support:
- SOC Analyst and Blue Team roles
- Identity and Access Management (IAM)
- Cloud Security Engineering
- Graduate-level study in cybersecurity, information security, and cloud computing

This work aligns with the expectations of research-oriented and applied graduate programs, including international scholarship frameworks such as **DAAD** and **Erasmus+**.
